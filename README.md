## Usage

DABoost is organized into directories for different estimation tasks.

### HLS

[hls](./hls) directory currently supports resource estimation and timing 
classification for HLS. To access these features,

```
cd [path to top directory]/hls
```

To preprocess our raw data and generate training and test datasets:
```
python preprocessing.py --data_dir [raw data directory containing 
                                    data.csv and feature_names.txt]
                        --output_dir [output data directory containing 
                                      .pkl files for main.py]
```

To run L1 feature selection, training, and testing for resource estimation:
```
python main.py --data_dir [data directory generated by preprocessing.py]
               --predict_area
```

To run L1 feature selection, training, and testing for timing classification:
```
python main.py --data_dir [data direcotry generated by preprocessing.py]
               --classify_timing
```
